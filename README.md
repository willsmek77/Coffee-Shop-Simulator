# CS 120 Module 2 Open-Ended Project
Will Smialek

## Program Summary
This is a game where you run a coffee shop. You manage your supply of materials, your shop upgrades, and you serve 
customers.

## Known Bugs
There are two functions that are missing all functionality (purchaseMaterials and upgradeShop). The serveNextCustomer 
function needs a lot of work as well.

## Future Work
I need to finish up the functions listed in the above section. I would like to overload the << operator to easily print 
all pertinent information about a CoffeeItem. I'm looking forward to the graphics module, because I have some ideas for
how I might want this program to look with some actual graphics. Also, I need to extend the testing program to properly
test everything.
